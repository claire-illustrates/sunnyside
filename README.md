## My process

I used this challenge to work on my core skills, particualrly layout and responsive sizing. I used Bootstrap for its grid system and collapsible navigation component. I added some enhancements for accessibility, including adjusting colour contrast ratios, labelling sections using ARIA, and adding a skip link to enable users to skip past the navigation to the main if they so choose.
